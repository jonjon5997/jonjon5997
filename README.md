# Hi, I'm Jonathan Sanfilippo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Front-End Developer** with a background in Education/Customer Experience -- crafting intuitive and accessible web applications. I have experience with:

- **Languages & Tools:** JavaScript, Typescript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, REST APIs
- **Key Projects:**
  - **PokÃ©dex App** â€“ A React-based app that fetches and displays PokÃ©mon data using the PokÃ©API.
  - **Spots App** â€“ A web application for discovering and sharing locations with integrated user authentication.
  - **WTWR: Weather App** - A sleek and user-friendly weather app that provides real-time weather updates for any location. Built with Express.js, it fetches data from a weather API to display current conditions, temperature, humidity, and more. The app also includes a clothing recommendation feature, suggesting appropriate attire based on the temperature and weather conditionsâ€”helping users dress comfortably for the day.

I'm always eager to learn and collaborate! Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me.  
ðŸš€ **Let's build something awesome together!**
